      <description>Wolf Tags has received a small update bringing one new feature and a bug fix.
Note: These features may take up to an hour to appear in your server. This is due to the nature of Discord slash commands. Please be patient.
&amp;ldquo;previewtag&amp;rdquo; Command Now, you can use the /previewtag command to view a tag&amp;rsquo;s contents without showing the entire server. Just use the command like the /tag command.
Activity is No Longer Shown Instead of using an activity (ex: &amp;ldquo;Playing (random website)&amp;rdquo;), Wolf Tags will now use the description for linking to the bot website.</description>

      <description>For those who did not know already, WolfieCBOT ESR will be shutting down on April 30th, 2022.
FAQ Why are you shutting WolfieCBOT ESR down?  WolfieCBOT ESR is not used in many servers. There are security issues with WolfieCBOT ESR that are unpatchable without completely rewriting the bot. Many of the features of WolfieCBOT ESR are locked down (ex: Moderation, Tags, etc.). Many of the features of WolfieCBOT ESR are being replicated with other Wolf Suite bots.</description>
