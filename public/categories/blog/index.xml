      <description>Wolf Tags has received an update!
Note: These features may take up to an hour to appear in your server. Please be patient while Discord updates the commands.
Tag Command Mentions Users Now, you can use the /tag command to mention a user with a tag. Very useful for those who don&amp;rsquo;t read.
Taginfo Content Can be Copied The /taginfo command now uses backticks to allow for easy copying.
Boring Developer Stuff  README file on GitHub repository now shows installation instructions, along with license information and a prettier image.</description>

      <description>Wolf Tags has received a small update bringing one new feature and a bug fix.
Note: These features may take up to an hour to appear in your server. This is due to the nature of Discord slash commands. Please be patient.
&amp;ldquo;previewtag&amp;rdquo; Command Now, you can use the /previewtag command to view a tag&amp;rsquo;s contents without showing the entire server. Just use the command like the /tag command.
Activity is No Longer Shown Instead of using an activity (ex: &amp;ldquo;Playing (random website)&amp;quot;), Wolf Tags will now use the description for linking to the bot website.</description>

      <description>For those who did not know already, WolfieCBOT ESR will be shutting down on April 30th, 2022.
FAQ Why are you shutting WolfieCBOT ESR down?  WolfieCBOT ESR is not used in many servers. There are security issues with WolfieCBOT ESR that are unpatchable without completely rewriting the bot. Many of the features of WolfieCBOT ESR are locked down (ex: Moderation, Tags, etc.). Many of the features of WolfieCBOT ESR are being replicated with other Wolf Suite bots.</description>
