[Wolf Tags](https://wolf-suite.web.app/bots/wolf-tags) has received a small update bringing one new feature and a bug fix.

**Note**: These features may take up to an hour to appear in your server. This is due to the nature of Discord slash commands. Please be patient.

## "previewtag" Command

Now, you can use the `/previewtag` command to view a tag's contents without showing the entire server. Just use the command like the `/tag` command. 

## Activity is No Longer Shown
Instead of using an activity (ex: "Playing (random website)"), Wolf Tags will now use the description for linking to the bot website. This is for less redundancy, as users still have access to this information.

**That's all the new content! Thanks for reading!**
