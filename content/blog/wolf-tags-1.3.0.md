[Wolf Tags](https://wolf-suite.web.app/bots/wolf-tags) has received an update!

**Note**: These features may take up to an hour to appear in your server. Please be patient while Discord updates the commands.

## Create Tag & Edit Tag Have Modals

The `/createtag` command and `/edittag` command now have Modals! This is a fairly new Discord feature that allows bots to have forms. 

## Tag Commands Disabled in DMs
All tag related commands are now disabled in DMs through Discord instead of a check by the bot. This will help to prevent confusion.

## Global Commands Have Been Reset
This means that all of the fields of the tag commands have been updated. This also means you may have to redo permissions for certain commands. 

## Boring Developer Stuff
- UUID was added as a dependency for the modal custom IDs. 

**That's all the new content! Thanks for reading!**
