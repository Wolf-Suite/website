We at Wolf Suite acknowledge your concern for your privacy. This is our Privacy Policy, which states how we use your data.

## Definitions of Terms
The terms “us”, “our”, or “we” refer to the Wolf Suite organization.

The terms “you” or “user” refers to anyone that uses our services.

The terms “server” or “guild” refer to a group of people on the service Discord.

The term "tag" refers to a feature of Wolf Tags that stores information in a database.

## Wolf Tags
### What We Collect
Wolf Tags stores data in a Firestore database. We collect User IDs (for the person who created the tag), Server IDs, Tag Title, and Tag Content. This is necessary for the bot's intended purpose.

### What We Do With This Information
Wolf Tags only stores this information to provide necessary functions, such as moderating who can edit a tag. Your data is never shared to anyone else. 

### Opting Out
Wolf Tags only collects information once a user has created a tag. Once all the tags in a server are deleted, the database automatically deletes the Server ID. Tags will persist, even if the bot is removed from the server, until all of the tags are deleted. If you wish to have this data removed, please contact us.

## Website
### What We Collect
The Wolf Suite website is made in such a way that no information is necessary to collect. We do not use any analytic program to store your information.
